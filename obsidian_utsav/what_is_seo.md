### Glossary

Here's a short glossary of important terms used in this guide:

-   **Crawl** - The process of looking for new or updated web pages. Google discovers URLs by following links, by reading sitemaps, and by many other means. _Google crawls the web, looking for new pages, then indexes them (when appropriate)._
-   **Crawler** - Automated software that crawls (fetches) pages from the web and indexes them.
-   **Googlebot** - The generic name of Google's crawler. _Googlebot crawls the web constantly._
-   **SEO** - Search engine optimization: the process of making your site better for search engines. Also the job title of a person who does this for a living: _We just hired a new SEO to improve our presence on the web.
