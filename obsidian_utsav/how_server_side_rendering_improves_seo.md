A great user experience comprises many facets, but Google has identified three foundational elements that every site should possess:

-   **Loading Experience**: Google uses the metric “Largest Contentful Paint” (LCP) to measure the perceived load speed for the user. LCP marks the point at which the page’s main content has fully loaded. [Learn more](https://web.dev/lcp/). #LoadingExperience
-   **Interactivity:** Google uses the metric “First Input Delay” (FID) to measure how users are able to interact with the page. FID measures things like how responsive the page is, and is the most quantifiable measure of how the user likely feels when trying to navigate and perform actions on the page. [Learn more](https://web.dev/fid/). #Interactivity
-   **Visual Stability:** Google uses the metric “Cumulative Layout Shift” (CLS) to measure how stable the page’s layout is. In other words, how much does the layout change unexpectedly for the user? [Learn more](https://web.dev/cls/).  #VisualStability

Google explains that these metrics are a combination of other metrics — again, as a way to streamline page experience metrics. For example, you can’t have a good LCP if you have a poor [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/) and [Time to First Byte (TTFB)](https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/).
